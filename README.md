Description:
This is an enclosed device meant for biological experiments on plants based
on light variances. It consists of a PVC tube that contains a water pump, LED
light array, temp sensor, light sensor, and various other pieces of hardware.
Everything is controlled by a microcontroller (Raspberry pi zero) that is connected 
via wifi to an external computer (Raspberry pi 3), which houses the UI and collects
experimental data.
